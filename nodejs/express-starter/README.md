## Starter kit

First, install ``npm`` client and the ``express-generator`` module.

Then, to create this project, the scaffolding command is:

```
express express-starter
```

## Deploy to Cloud Foundry

This starter template also includes a manifest file which can be used
to deploy to Cloud Foundry. Just run ``cf push``.

To specify a custom domain, just do ``cf push -d yeukhon.internal.company.com``.
